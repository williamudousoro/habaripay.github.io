# API Specifications

### Specification For Virtual Accounts

#### API KEYS (Test Environment)

1. Create an account on our sandbox environment: sandbox.squadco.com
2. Retrieve keys from the bottom of the Get Started Page

:::caution
Authorization Any request made without the authorization key will fail with a 401 (Service Not Authorized) response code.
:::

:::info
Authorization would be done via Headers using Keys gotten from your dashboard.
:::

**Example:**
Authorization: Bearer sandbox_sk_94f2b798466408ef4d19e848ee1a4d1a3e93f104046f

This API specification helps you create a virtual account and also integrates payment reconciliation for your customers.

You can also trace payments to virtual accounts and link them up with customer details.

:::note
Reconciliation: For instant settlement when using our Virtual Account, All merchant and beneficiary accounts must be GTCO Bank Accounts.
:::

### Creating Virtual Account

:::info
You need to make a POST Request to a dedicated endpoint containing your customer information.
:::

#### IMPORTANT NOTICE

:::note
**Please note that there is a new compliance rule put in place to mitigate against fraud. As a result, all virtual accounts must carry a slug as a prefix to the name. The slug must be a portion of your business name or abbreviations of your business name as one word. Please note that slash (/) is not allowed and only hyphen (-) can be used.
Please be informed that all accounts without the prefix will be flagged by our compliance team and might ultimately be closed.**
:::

### Sample Request of create endpoint with Slug

If my business name is TechZilla Solutions, then I will have to create my account with the format below:

```
Business Model
{
    "customer_identifier": "CCC",
    "business_name": "Techzilla-Joseph Okoye",
    "mobile_num": "08139011943",
    "bvn": "12343211654",
    "beneficiary_account": "4920299492"
}


Customer Model

### Business Model

This allows you to create virtual accounts for people whose customers are actually businesses (B2B) or other merchants and might not be able to provide all the necessary details that a customer should have.

#### IMPORTANT NOTICE

### Transaction Notification Service

Upon registration and verification as a merchant, you are to create a Webhook and add on your Squad Dashboard to receive notification on payments.

:::caution
**WEBHOOK: If a webhook is not provided, notifications won't be sent.**
:::

:::caution  
**KINDLY ENSURE YOU HAVE A TRANSACTION REFERENCE CHECKER WHEN IMPLEMENTING WEBHOOKS TO AVOID GIVING DOUBLE VALUE ON TRANSACTIONS.**
:::

### Webhook Validation

### Method 1 (Hash Comparison)

The webhook notification sent carry the x-squad-signature in the header. The hash value (x-squad-signature) is an HMAC SHA512 signature of the webhook payload signed using your secret key.

You are expected to create a hash and compare the value of the hash created with the hash sent in the header of the POST request sent to your webhook URL.

To create the hash, you use the entire payload sent via the webhook.

To create the hash, you use the entire payload sent via the webhook.

### Method 2 (Decryption of Encrypted Body)

To validate the webhook sent to you, you are expected to decrypt the hashed body (encrypted_body) of data sent via the webhook using the Public and Secret Key found on your squad dashboard.

The result of this decryption is to be compared against the body of data sent from the webhook, if they match then you can trust that the notification is from squad and if they don't then you know the notification didn't originate from squad and you are expected to ignore such notifications.

To decrypt the hashed body, kindly visit our encryption and decryption page for sample decryption functions in different languages.

## WEBHOOK ERROR LOG

This API allows you retrieve all your missed webhook transactions and use it to update your record without manual input.

- The top 100 missed webhook will always be returned by default and it
- This flow involves integration of two(2) APIs
- Once you have updated the record of a particular transaction, you are expected to use the second API to delete the record from the error log. If this is not done, the transaction will continuously be returned to you in the first 100 transactions until you delete it.
- This will only work for those who respond correctly to our webhook calls.
- **Also, ensure you have a transaction duplicate checker to ensure you don't update a record twice or update a record you have updated using the webhook or the transaction API.**

:::caution
Authorization Any request made without the authorization key (secret key) will fail with a 401 (Unauthorized) response code.
:::

:::info
The authorization key is sent via the request header as Bearer Token Authorization
:::

**Example:**
Authorization: Bearer sandbox_sk_94f2b798466408ef4d19e848ee1a4d1a3e93f104046f
