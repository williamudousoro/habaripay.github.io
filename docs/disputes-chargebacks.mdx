# Disputes & Chargebacks

##### This contains a list of APIs that allow you get all disputes raised on your transaction, reject the claim with an evidence or accept the claim and accept a charge back to be performed.

You have the option to either accept or reject a chargeback

### Accepting a chargeback:

This means you received the customer’s payment but did not provide the service or product the customer requested for some reasons. When you accept a chargeback, you allow for the funds to be deducted from your payouts and reversed to the customer’s bank account.

### Rejecting a chargeback:

This means you received the customer’s payment and have provided the service or delivered the product to the customer. To justify your claim you are required to provide an evidence to show that value has been given for payment made by the customer. If the evidence is not sufficient, we will automatically accept the chargeback.

:::caution Authorization
