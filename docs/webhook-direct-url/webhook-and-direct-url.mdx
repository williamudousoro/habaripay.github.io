# Webhook & Redirect URL

Webhooks are used so that anytime an event occurs on your account, your application can be notified with instant, real-time notifications by Squad.

Squad webhooks are HTTP calls that are triggered by specific events. It is necessary only for behind-the-scenes transactions.

This can be set up on your Squad Dashboard by specifying a URL we would send POST requests to whenever a successful transaction occurs.

To process notifications, you need to:

Paste your redirect and **Callback/Webhook URL** in the space provided on your dashboard by following the steps below:

- Login to your Squad dashboard.
- Go to Profile > API & Webhook.
- In the Webhook URL field, enter your Notification URL.
- In the redirect URL field, enter your redirect URL- and on completion of payment, the customer will be redirected to the URL with the transaction reference passed as a query param.
- Enter a redirect URL for your customers to be redirected after they complete payment.

:::note
The Redirect URL is optional.

:::caution
**KINDLY ENSURE YOU HAVE A TRANSACTION REFERENCE CHECKER WHEN IMPLEMENTING WEBHOOKS TO AVOID GIVING DOUBLE VALUE ON TRANSACTIONS.**
